# Request-Forwarder-for-Burp
Just a simple script for Burp Suite to set annoying domains you don't want to intercept while interception is on, everytime you close Burp the proxy settings are not saved (i know you can still save but it's annoying everytime to load these settings), hardcoded list of hosts you dont want to be intercepted (self.hostsToForward variable)
